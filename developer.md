This is our Java coding standard.


File names, packages:
* Use only lowercase letters in package names
* The first letters of all words in class names are uppercase
* Class names must be nouns

Method and variable names
* The first letter must be lowercase in the name of the methods, and the first letters of inner words - uppercase letters
* Variable names begin with a lowercase letter, and the first letters of inner words - uppercase letters
* All letters are uppercase in the names of constants, the words are separated by lower underscores

Indentation, line breaks
* The line doesn’t exceed 80 characters
* If it exceeds, then you need to break it into several lines:
  * Transfer after a comma and before the operator
  * Use indent two tabulation to indicate nesting
* Use indent tabulation

Arrangement of brackets, operators, blocks
* The definition of variables must be placed at the beginning of the block
* There is no space between the method name and the brackets for the parameters
* Space separated:
  * Function parameters
  * Operators
  * Keyword (if, while, for) and the next bracket
* Opening bracket { doesn’t fit on a separate line
* The closing bracket } is aligned with the start line of this block and is located on a new line
* Methods are separated by an empty string
* There is only one statement on the line

Code structuring
* Methods should be short and with comments
* Lack of magic numbers

Such rules are accepted in our team.
